# Help Book Viewer

The Help Book Viewer app lets you view the contents of help books for Mac apps.

Why create this app when Apple has a Help Viewer app? The Help Viewer app requires you to register your help book in order to show it. The usual way to register the help book is to add it to your Xcode project and run the app. When you start making a help book, you may want to see how it looks without adding it to your project. The Help Viewer app lets you see how the help book looks without having to register it.

## Using the App

1. Click the Choose Book button in the toolbar.
2. Select your help book from the Open panel.
3. Click the Open button.
